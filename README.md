# roadWanderer
An app to take you places

An interface with Google Maps which helps you plan road trips, Sunday afternoons, or general adventure. 

TBD:

(Everything)

1. User inputs start and end locations, and perhaps a fraction of the trip (e.g. 1/3) at which they'd like to take a break and explore.

2. Backend needs to find a way to say "what's 1/3 of the way along the trip, within a certain radius?"

3. Maybe the user can input categories, like parks, malls, monuments, etc.

4. Also allow the user to set a radius or time restriction so we don't route them too far off course.
